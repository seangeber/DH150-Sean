# DH150-Sean
Heuristic evaluation by Sean Geber, student in DH 150 - UX Design

## Motivation
I will be performing a heuristic examination of the government websites for my hometown, the city of Torrance, and a place that I also call home, the city of Los Angeles. These cities have shaped my worldview and overall character, and I want to show my gratitude by helping to improve their websites to serve as a better resource for their inhabitants, including myself.


### Websites

City of Torrance homepage
http://torranceca.gov

The government website for the city of Torrance is a comprehensive platform that contains all information relevant to the city, its services, facilities, business, government, and more. I believe that while the website is informative, it is intimidating at first glance and could be made easier to navigate and more inviting for its users.

City of Los Angeles homepage

The government website for the city of Los Angeles is a comprehensive platform that works similarly to the Torrance website except that it operates on a larger scale to accomodate its greater population. I believe that the website could benefit from UX features such as drop-down menus and a help or support section that would allow its users to find what they are looking for faster.
